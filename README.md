# Multi-Core-Extractor
A tool used to bulk extract .tar files that is multi threaded and auto detects cpu cores!

This tool is a pre step before using Learning-Data-Generator.
 
 1. Create Dir and place py file inside.
 2. Within that Dir create two sub Dir called demos and output.
 3. Place all compressed tar demos in the demos folder. 
 3. Run go.py to enjoy multi threaded extarcting of all demos in the folder :)
